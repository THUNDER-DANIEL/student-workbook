# Day 4 - CHECKPOINT

Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

        Alittle bit of scrum leadership. Follow examples and made them our own. I really enjoyed working with Kevin. He was a paitent and fun guy!

What went well?

            We both understand the overall desired outcome and did a great job planning out (whiteboard out) page features, route actions and planned out the next day.

What would you do differently?

        More "driving" and "navigating" switching and help leading the direction of the current task.
