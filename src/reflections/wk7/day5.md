# Day 5 - END WEEK 7

Weekly Reflections (Optional)
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

        a fellow could understand. Nothing against Mark but it's good to learn a different way once and a awhile. As Mark famously said
        "It doesn't get easier you become better" very true.
