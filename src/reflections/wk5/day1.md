What is the purpose of a Query String?

        Query string allows you to pass information to and from a website by simply adding, or “appending,” that information to the end of a URL.

What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

        portion of a URL is the part of the URL after the question mark - starts after the question mark ex:(?answer=42). Distinguishing by the  " & ".
