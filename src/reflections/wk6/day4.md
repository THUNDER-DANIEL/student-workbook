# Day 4 - USING AUTH0 IN VUEJS AND REVUE ADVANCED FRONTEND FRAMEWORKS

Read Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > Using Nested Routes in Vue.js and answer the following questions

What is a nested route?

        Component inside component(nested).The actual nesting will be implemented inside the Users component.Because components are independent, one component can refresh without affecting other components or the UI as a whole.

When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

        To use a child-component from a parent component to render. Examples would be Flights(parent)
        type of airlines(child)

Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

            Yes then to render a varible from that parent component.
