# Day 5  End of Week 1

Weekly Reflections (Optional)
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

        To begin I am thankful. Above of all the deep feeling of doubt and imposter syndrome I'm thankful for the 2nd chance to become a developer. I was impressed by the first day the way Jake and Mark had compassion and a true underdstanding of the emotions to come. To me that speaks volumes of this team.
        I've struggled with what I feel are more advance topics of the material. For example Bootstrap-I was familiar with the basic Containers/Rows/Columns but the kick in the face was the design for smaller view screens (i.e. smartphones and tablets). But I will stay up dark and early and will never quit  developing my future. Thank you Codeworks.
