# Day 2 - HTML / CSS

Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > CSS and answer the following questions

### 1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
        Is a keyword added to the selector to do a assigned task.
        If had to guess maybe :hover.


### 2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
    Specificity is like the ref in a sports game - it ultmately *helps* decides the score and rank of style declarations. The benefit is decide the outcome and you can decide to adjust any properties.


### 3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
    In CSS it over rides the best practice of the code hierarchy and cuts into the specificity by overriding it.
