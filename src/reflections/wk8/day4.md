# Day 4 - Week 8

Read Working In a Professional Environment > Testing in Vue and answer the following questions

What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

        -Unit Testing: Single unit of codes giving you testing isolation.

        -Component Testing: Testing vue components, either solo components or components being intergrated with others.

        -End-To-End (E2E) Testing: front and back end testing. How will the user experince the app-testing all layers.

What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

                Unit testing just because it's a bite size and baby step approach to testing. Ensuring all the little bits of code are working. Also could be fast to the testing timeline - dealing with small pieces of code.

What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

                E2E because it's looking at the bigger picture. If one thing is off then the whole thing isn't ready. Also the other two have already covered the majority of testing.
