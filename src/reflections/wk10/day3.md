# Day 3 - DOTNET WEBAPI'S SERVICE LAYER

Read Foundations of C# > C# Enum's and answer the following questions

What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

        Enum are used to assign constant names to a group of numeric integer values. If you need to associated a month to it's number value in a calendar order(January, 1).

How can you modify an Enum?

        Basically how you would change/assign the INT value from it's default you can make to an enum is to set the value of an enum member. By default, the first member of an enum takes the value of zero. If this value doesn't make sense for your enum, you can change it to one or some other number.

How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

        I dont't believe so, but assigning a INT value to maybe a string within a class.
