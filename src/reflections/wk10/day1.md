# Day 1 - INTRODUCTION TO C#

Read Foundations of C# > C# Data Types and answer the following questions

What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

        Value Data Types.
        Reference Data Types.
        Pointer Data Type.
        How it' held in memory and stored in memory.

What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

        C# provides the following built-in value types, also known as simple types:
        Integral numeric types(INT)
        Floating-point numeric types
        bool that represents a Boolean value
        char that represents a Unicode UTF-16 character. Difference is INT in c# vs number in JS simple changes in syntax.

In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

        Reference types are stored in a large heap but it gives you a map  and pointer to it's location.

        Unlike value types, a reference type doesn't store its value directly. Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored. Value data types directly contain values.
