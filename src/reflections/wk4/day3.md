Read Asynchronous Code > Async and Await and answer the following questions

        Asynchronous code doesn't have to wait â€“ your program can continue to run. Prepending the async keyword to any function means that the function will return a promise and wraps non-promises in it.

What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?
                
                async & wait with a try and catch 
                within the function()

What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?

                Smoother way of running the JS MVCS machine. With promises along with the wait method helps things fire off then they work in harmony.
