Read Asynchronous Code > What is REST and answer the following questions


        

What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

        RE-presentational State Transfer. It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.

What does Stateless mean?

        Stateless means the server does not remember anything about the user who uses the API. It doesn't remember if the user of the API already sent a GET request for the same resource in the past, it doesn't remember which resources the user of the API requested before, and so on.

What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

        HTTP headers (e.g. Content-Type: and Accept: )
        GET parameters (e.g. &format=json )
        resource label (e.g. /foo. json )
