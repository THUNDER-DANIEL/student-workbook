# Day 1 - INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT

What is Scope ?

        Scope in JavaScript refers to the accessibility or visibility of variables. That is, which parts of a program have access to the variable or where the variable is visible.

What is Hoisting ?

        Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.

In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

        VAR declarations are globally scoped
        let and const are block scoped. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared. Const won't let you change the value.
