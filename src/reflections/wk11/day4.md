# Day 4 - FULL-STACK REVIEW

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

                This course was a great experience in the kingdom that is JavaScript. Learning project structure (MVC) and how information is passed on, populated, and stored.

                I've enjoyed the laughs and the struggles. The late nights and long days in the coding trenches. Thank you for jump starting my belief again.
