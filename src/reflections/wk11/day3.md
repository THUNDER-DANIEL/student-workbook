# Day 3 - DOTNET WEBAPI REVIEW

Read Dotnet WebAPI's > SQL Injection, and answer the following questions

What is SQL injection?

        SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database.

What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?

        SQL injections typically fall under three categories: In-band SQLi (Classic), Inferential SQLi (Blind) and Out-of-band SQLi.

How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

        As SQL injection attacks exploit vulnerable Web application and database code, the only way to prevent them is to resolve your code's vulnerabilities. Any place that code dynamically generates a SQL query using data from an external source should be closely checked.
