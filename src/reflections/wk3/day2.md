# Day 2 - ENCAPSULATION
Read Advancing with JS > Encapsulation in JavaScript and answer the following questions


What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

            Encapsulation is a process of binding the data/variables with the functions acting on that data

What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

        If you use the underscore convention, you rely on the user to know what it means and to understand that you don't intend for them to use it. 



How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

         A variable defined in a factory or constructor function scope is private to that function.
        Privileged method is a method which has access to the private data inside the containing function's scope (also known as the lexical environment). Privileged functions and methods have reference-based access to the containing function's variables even after the containing function has returned.
