# Day 5 - END WEEK 3

Weekly Reflections (Optional)
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

            I am very thankful to here.
             I was able to finally grasp MVC.  I can now see why there are so many moving pieces. In a strange way I feel like I learn more in the pressure of the checkpoints than normal weekly assignments. Because by then I have a wide range of abilites to use in the checkpoint.
            It's a no messing around process at Codeworks.
