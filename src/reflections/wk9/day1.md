# Day 1 - CAPSTONES 1

What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

        Vue framework/ Auth0 to handle user log in and out and their account/ Postman for backend testing/ MongoDB to keep data.

What went well so far?

        Planning Terlo and figma were great. And we worked together and build the server side.

What would you do differently? Why?

        Creating a better sense of teamwork because towards the end people thought they were better off working alone. And I feel it distrubed the final leg of capstones.
